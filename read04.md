# CSS Grid

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Unlike Flexbox, it is perfect for designing entire layouts. It is a perfect alternative to use floats, that can generate random behaviors. It allows you to grab of container element, define a grid inside it and then move the elements according to the grid lines.

It starts with attaching display: grid | inline-grid; to the container element. Then you define the grid using grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. The coder can also use grid-template-area, grid-area. This can use define an area as header, footer, etc.

Once you have the grid defined, Grid has a plethora of commands to arrange the elements inside the container. Many commands are the same or similar to flex-box commands, such as justify-content, align-self.

##### To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid

* set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
* then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row
* The element on which display: grid is applied. Itâ€™s the direct parent of all the grid items
* CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. Finally two   dimensional layouts are becoming simpler!
